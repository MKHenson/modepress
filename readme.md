# Modepress
A simple Mongo-Node CMS server. The server is accessed via a RESTful API.

## Current stable version
* v0.5.0

## Requirements
* MongoDB v3
* Node 6.2
* [Webinate-Users](https://github.com/Webinate/users)
* **Tested Ubuntu v14**
* [Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md)

## Installation

1) Make sure the requirements are installed and running
2) Create a folder where you want to store the modepress project

```
mkdir modepress
cd modepress
```

3) Run as an admin / or make sure you have write privileges in the modepress folder
```
sudo su
```

4) Download and install the desired version from github
If you want the latest stable version:

```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Webinate/modepress/master/install-script.sh | bash
```

OR if you want the dev build

```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Webinate/modepress/dev/install-script-dev.sh | bash
```

This downloads the latest modepress project into the current folder.

5) Install the dependencies, and build the source code

```
npm install
gulp install
gulp build
```

After you call the build task, a dist folder is created. This represents your distribution folder.
You still need to install the dependencies for this folder, so go into it and do an npm install

 ```
cd dist
npm install
```


6) The dist folder comes with an example config json file. These config files are used to start and configure your modepress instance.
Its best to leave the example file as is and make a copy for yourself to edit.

```
cp example-config.json config.json
```

Now edit the config.json to suite your needs.

7) To run the modepress server

```
node main.js --config="config.json" --logFile="logs.log" --logging="true" --numThreads="max"
```

By default modepress will run using all threads available to your application. If however memory is in short supply you
can set the number of threads in the command line

```
node main.js --config="config.json" --numThreads="max"
node main.js --config="config.json" --numThreads="4"
```
