## Requirements
* [MongoDB v3](https://www.mongodb.com/)
* [Node 6.2](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Goole Developers account](https://console.developers.google.com)
* [Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md)

## Installation

1) Make sure all the requirements are installed before continuing. Create a folder on your server with write permissions, then go into that folder

```
sudo mkdir users
cd users
```
2) Download the users project from gitgub

If you want the latest stable release
```
sudo curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Webinate/users/master/install-script.sh | bash
```
If you want the latest dev release
```
sudo curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Webinate/users/dev/install-script-dev.sh | bash
```

3) Call 'npm install' to load the dependencies for building the project from source code

	npm install

4) Now build the project with gulp

    gulp build

This will create a dist folder that contains the built application. But we still need to add the dependencies that
the application itself requires.

    cd dist
	npm install

The dist folder contains an example-config.json. This file contains all the settings of your users instance and is required for startup.
Its advisable that you do not edit this file directly, and instead make a copy of it and use the copy instead.

    cp example-config.json config.json

Now edit the config with your server's setup details.
